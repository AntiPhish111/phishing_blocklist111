# Phishing_blocklist111


Phishing_blocklist111 is a partially automated anti-phishing blocklist. This blocklist is usually updated daily and is available in text format. They mainly contain phishing links but also sometimes other types of malicious links. This data is shared with several organizations to ensure any malicious URLs get taken down as ultimately that is the best way of stopping people from getting scammed or downloading malware. Once a link is in the blocklist, it will stay there even if it goes inactive.
