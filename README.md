# Phishing_blocklist111


Phishing_blocklist111 is a partially automated anti-phishing blocklist.

The blocklist is usually updated daily and is available in text format. The blocklists contain mainly phishing links but also sometimes malware or other malicious links. This data is shared with several organizations to ensure any malicious URLs get taken down as ultimately that is the best way of stopping people from getting scammed or downloading malware.

Once a link is in the blocklist, it will stay there even if it goes inactive. If you'd like to report new malicious URLs or a false postive, please open a GitHub issue.
